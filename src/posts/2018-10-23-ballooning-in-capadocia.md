excerpt: I have been lucky to have flown in hot air balloons many times with my father, Alf Erickson, who took us on many wonderful journeys ballooning in Europe. For the interested reader, these, and many more of my father’s eclectic interests, are documented in his pioneering blog, corkscrew-balloon.com.
